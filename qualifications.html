                            Since Spring 2021, I've been a Programming Lead for the Women in Engineering VEX U Robotics Competition Team. You can 
                            learn more about my robotics experience in the Projects tab. My responsibilities as a Programming Lead involve teaching 
                            junior members basic C++ and Git version control. I also help debug over 1000 lines of source code and delegate major
                            programming components to junior members. I and my fellow leads take over some of the more time-critical components
                            if unexpected difficulties arise close to the competitions.

                            Since freshman year, I've been a member of the Sketch Recognition Lab under Dr. Tracy Hammond. I completed two reports
                            on the <a href = "https://www.veoride.com/texas-am/" target = "_blank">VeoRide bikeshare system</a> at Texas A&M, which you can read more about in the Projects tab. This year, I plan to
                            extend my VeoRide work into an undergraduate honors thesis. I plan to remain active in research throughout my education,
                            so I'll most likely start a new project in senior year once I complete my work with the VeoRide system.
