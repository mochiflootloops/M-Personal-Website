            VEX U Robotics Programming Lead
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since Spring 2021, I've been a Programming Lead for the Women in Engineering VEX U Robotics Competition Team. You can 
            learn more about my robotics experience in the Projects tab. My responsibilities as a Programming Lead involve teaching 
            junior members basic C++ and Git version control. I also help debug over 1000 lines of source code and delegate major
            programming components to junior members. I and my fellow leads take over some of the more time-critical components
            if unexpected difficulties arise close to the competitions.

            Undergraduate Researcher
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since freshman year, I've been a member of the Sketch Recognition Lab under Dr. Tracy Hammond. I completed two reports
            on the VeoRide bkeshare system at Texas A&M, which you can read more about in the Projects tab. This year, I plan to
            extend my VeoRide work into an undergraduate honors thesis. I plan to remain active in research throughout my education,
            so I'll most likely start a new project in senior year once I complete my work with the VeoRide system.

            Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
        </h2>
        <p>
            In sophomore year (2021-22), I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant. I TA'ed for the Engineering Department's Python
            coding class, which is mandatory for all freshmen in the College of Engineering. I assisted a class of over 90 students by
            grading their weekly coding assignments and leading in-class exam reviews. I also held office hours for the Department of
            Computer Science, where I helped students with assignments in two CS classes: Intro to Program Design; and Data Structures
            and Algorithms. Both classes were taught in C++.
