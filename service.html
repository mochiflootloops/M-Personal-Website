            IntelliChoice Math Tutor
        </h2>
        <p>
            In high school, I volunteered at my city's public library as a math tutor. I taught kids across a range of math levels,
            from basic arithmetic to high school algebra. I would tutor on Tuesdays for around two hours in the evening.

        <h2>
            PISD Band Volunteer
        </h2>
        <p>
            During my time in the Plano Independent School District, I would volunteer to help set up, conduct, and clean up various
            events for the school bands. I started this practice in middle school, when I first joined the school band, and continued
            through high school until the pandemic.

        <h2>
            Library Volunteer
        </h2>
        <p>
            Because I'm a massive bookworm, the library has always been one of my favorite places to hang out and decompress. During 
            my junior year of high school, I was a summer volunteer for the Davis Library, part of the Plano Public Library System.
            I would mainly help reshelve and organize books, and volunteer to help set up and conduct events largely geared towards
            children and/or families.

            Flutist
        </h2>
        <p>
            I've been playing the flute since 5th grade, so for almost 10 years. In high school, I auditioned for and joined a flute 
            ensemble program hosted by the Southern Methodist University Meadows School of Arts in downtown Dallas. I was part of the 
            program's first and second iterations, and I got the chance to work with some truly amazing flutists from around the 
            Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. We got several chances to perform at SMU concerts, and once memorably performed at a wedding
            held on the campus grounds. While the experience was not necessarily built around service, I viewed our performances as a way
            of giving thanks to SMU and its faculty for creating and sponsoring the program.
