                    In high school, I volunteered at one of my city's public library as a math tutor. I taught kids across a range of math levels,
                    from basic arithmetic to high school algebra. I would tutor on Tuesdays for around two hours in the evening. The tutoring
                    program was a chapter of the <a href = "https://www.intellichoice.org/">Intellichoice organization</a>.

                    During my time in the Plano Independent School District, I would volunteer to help set up, conduct, and clean up various
                    events for the school bands. I started this practice in middle school, when I first joined the school band, and continued
                    through high school until the pandemic.

                    Because I'm a massive bookworm, the library has always been one of my favorite places to hang out and decompress. During 
                    my junior year of high school, I was a summer volunteer for the Davis Library, part of the Plano Public Library System.
                    I would mainly help reshelve and organize books, and volunteer to help set up and conduct events largely geared towards
                    children and/or families.

                    I've been playing the flute since 5th grade, so for almost 10 years. In high school, I auditioned for and joined a flute 
                    ensemble program hosted by the Southern Methodist University Meadows School of Arts in downtown Dallas. I was part of the 
                    program's first and second iterations, and I got the chance to work with some truly amazing flutists from around the 
                    Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. We got several chances to perform at SMU concerts, and once memorably performed at a wedding
                    held on the campus grounds. While the experience was not necessarily built around service, I viewed our performances as a way
                    of giving thanks to SMU and its faculty for creating and sponsoring the program. You can view one of my performances
