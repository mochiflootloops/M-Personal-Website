                    Since freshman year, I have been a member of the <a href = "https://tamuwevexu.wixsite.com/website" target = "_blank">Women in Engineering VEX U Competition Team (WE VEX U)</a>. 
                    Our team aims to give women in engineering majors a platform and safe space to apply their engineering knowledge outside 
                    the classroom. We do this primarily by competing in the VEX U Robotics Competitions, for which we design two robots. 
                    Their functionality is based on the specific competition challenge, which is assigned each year. I am part of the 
                    Programming subteam: while our Mechanical team works on designing and building the robot in the fall, the Programming 
                    team learns basic C++ and Git version control. We also learn the basics of programming robot movement--autonomous and 
                    driver-controlled--using the PROS API. Once Mech starts building, we start testing completed components using an 
                    incremental, iterative design process. We do most of our debugging and match training in the spring, and we compete in 
                    Regionals around March each year. While we were unable to attend competition during the 2020-21 season due to COVID-19 
                    restrictions, our team qualified for the Worlds Competition this past spring, where we won the design award. I joined 
                    the Leadership Team in Spring 2021; you can read more about my lead-specific duties under the Experiences tab.

                I've been a member of the <a href = "https://srltamu.com/" target = "_blank">Sketch Recognition Lab</a> (PI: Dr. Tracy Hammond) since freshman year. My work is mainly centered
                around analyzing Texas A&M's bikeshare system, which is made possible through the outside vendor VeoRide. I used Python data
                analysis and visualizations packages such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze approximately 1.5 GB of bike usage data
                recorded between January 2019 and September 2020. I was able to identify major usage hotspots around campus and plot them on a
                map using the ArcGIS Pro software. To date, I've completed two reports on this topic that build off each other, with the 
                intention to expand this work into an Undergraduate honors thesis. In this thesis, I intend to extend my analysis with more
                recent data from Fall 2020 onwards and develop an intelligent, robust rebalancing algorithm using machine learning techniques 
                to improve customer experience and encourage more people to take advantage of sustainable transportation.

                    In Summer 2021, I was part of the <a href = "https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2020/08/the-success-of-the-sec-summer-internship.html" target = "_blank">Texas A&M SEC Directed Internship</a>. I was placed in a project team with five other
                    engineering majors from different departments--Electrial Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Chemical Engineering--and we
                    were tasked with researching the Texas power grid to find a way to make it more efficient and reduce its carbon footprint.
                    Our research led us to a two-pronged method. First, we designed drones that would be able to periodically apply an aerosol 
                    sealant onto power lines in order to reduce the amount of wasted energy that dissipates into the air during transmission.
                    Second, we developed a plan to install microgrids to decentralize the grid and provide a robust, reliable backup to the main 
                    grid in the event of mass outages (as you may be able to tell, we were heavily inspired by the severe winter storm that hit
                    Texas in February 2021). We developed a cost breakdown and prognosis, along with ethical considerations. We then presented
                    this work to a panel of sponsors. A link to our presentation slides can be found <a href = "docs/Version 2.5.pdf" target = "_blank">here</a>.
